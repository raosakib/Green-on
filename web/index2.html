The texture is the quality of a surface or the way any work of art is represented. There are three kinds of
basic textures, actual, simulated and the invented texture. Lines and shading can be used to create
different textures as well. For example, if one is portraying certain fabrics, one needs to give the feeling
of the right texture so that it closely resembles what the artist is trying to convey.
The surface quality of an object that we sense through touch. All objects have a physical texture. Artists
can also convey texture visually in two dimensions.
In a two-dimensional work of art, texture gives a visual sense of how an object depicted would feel in real
life if touched: hard, soft, rough, smooth, hairy, leathery, sharp, etc. In three-dimensional works, artists
use actual texture to add a tactile quality to the work.
